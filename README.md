## Chapter 1 : The Death of Steve Jobs

Sunday, August 11, 2011, Tim Cook got a call from Steve Jobs to go to his home. Steve was dying of cancer. 

Steve told Tim he wanted him to be the next CEO of Apple. Steve would become the chairman, but believed he would live much longer. 

### Cook the Cipher 

Many were surprised that Tim Cook would be the next CEO. He kept a low profile and nobody considered him the visionary Jobs was. Many expected chief designer Jony Ive or software executive Scott Forstall to be the next CEO. 

### Jobs resigns; Cook is CEO 

Most of the World believed Jobs would still maintain his presence at Apple. Tim would just follow Jobs' vision. As CEO, Cook tried to build a sense of company camaraderie. He addressed Apple employees as "Team" in his first company-wide email. He also personally interacted with many employees. 

### The Death of Steve Jobs 

Steve died on October 5, 2011. This had a tremendous cultural impact on the world. The entire world mourned Steve. 

### Running Steve Jobs's Company 

Being the CEO of Apple is a once-in-a-lifetime position, but it's also one of the riskiest Jobs. It was scary for Cook, and he faced the constant pressure of leading Apple. 

### Apple is Doomed 

Cook didn't have Jobs' imagination. Media pundits predicted that Apple would be doomed without Jobs. Apple had been at the top of the tech industry with Steve, but would fall without him. 

Greg Joswiak, a VP at Apple, said that if Cook was nervous, he didn't show it. The world wanted to compare Cook to Steve, but Cook wasn't trying to be Steve. 

Cook brought his unique strengths to the table. Cook knew that Jobs didn't choose Cook to be exactly like him. 

## Chapter 2 : A Worldview Shaped by the Deep South 

### Sweet Home Alabama 

Tim Cook was born on November 1, 1960 in Mobile, Alabama. Tim had a good relationship with his parents. 

### School Days 

Tim went to school in a small town called Robertsdale. Tim's family was also religious which shaped him into being a kind and generous man. When Tim came out as gay, he referred to being gay as one of God's gifts. 

As a student, Tim excelled in Math. In 1978, Tim graduated as salutatorian. Teachers recalled that Tim was very reliable, which would translate into the workforce. 

Tim was also well liked and had a warm personality. Tim's high school friends are proud of what he's achieved. 

### Early Business Experience 

Tim showed glimpses of business acumen at an early age. He worked several jobs (restaurant, pharmacy, newspaper) and was the business manager for his school's yearbook. He was in charge with selling yearbooks and used the slogan "Have you got yours?" 

### How Robertsdale Forged Cook's WorldView

Robertsdale did have Racism, though it was less overt than neighboring richer towns. Cook would also experience racism on his own. As a young boy, he claims he saw members of the KKK light a local black business on fire. However, many Robertsdale residents claim that Cook is lying about that incident. The residents don't want to be publicly associated with the Klan, so they'd deny Cook's story, yet it's very likely Cook was telling the truth. 

When Cook was 16, he won an essay competition to meet president Jimmy Carter and Alabama governor George Wallace. Wallace was a segregationist and racist and according to Cook, meeting Wallace was not an honor. Cook grew up to become the complete opposite. Many of his policies implemented at Apple were a result of his experiences of discrimination growing up. 

### Roots of Alabama Activism 

Cook has maintained his principles throughout his career. He expressed his belief that a person should not have to choose between "doing good and doing well." Cook didn't always do things with consideration to the bottom line. He had a moral compass which led him to fight clmate change and donate to charity. 

Jobs on the other hand cared very little about Apple's social impact on the world and believed building great products was good enough. This is what separated Cook from Jobs, as he wanted Apple to be a "force for good". 

Cook's morality was rooted in his Christian upbringing, and he idolized Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. His support of marganilized groups also was influenced by his experience growing up as gay in the South. 

Tim did not come out as gay growing up in Robertsdale because it would've been very difficult for him. Gays were shunned and harrassed. By coming out as Gay in his later years, he paved a path for others to come out as gay as well. 

### Hometown Nonhero 

While some of classmates are proud of what Cook has achieved, many feel that Cook hasn't done enough to help the residents there. Apple is not investing in Robertsdale because Alabama hasn't passed any antidiscrimination laws. There were attempts with Representative Todd passing a nondiscrimination bill, but it wasn't signed into law, as the Republicans were the majority.

Still, Tim did donate a portion of his personal wealth to Human Rights Campaign to fund an $8.5 million campaign in Alabama among other states. Cook also donated iPads to poor school systems in Alabama. However Cook, made it very clear he wouldn't expand business in Alabama until they passed nondiscrimination laws. 

### Engineering at Auburn 

Cook graduated highschool in 1978 and attended Auburn University, pursuing a bachelors in industrial engineering. One of Cook's professors remembered him as a solid B-plus or A-minus student. Tim also learned to program. 

Auburn had a significant impact on Cook's worldview. The Auburn creed states, 

    "I believe this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work. I believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work wisely and trains my mind and my hands to work skillfully. I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men."

and Cook echoed it at a commencement speech at Auburn in 2010. Cook would address the crowd, 

    "Those who try to achieve success without hard work ultimately deceive themselves, or worse, deceive others." 

Cook graduated from Auburn in 1982, and took a job at IBM, in the infancy stages of the tech industry. 
 
## Chapter 3 : Learning The Trade at Big Blue 

### The IBM PC 

At the time, IBM was the center of the tech industry. In 1982, IBM released their Personal Computer, which quickly became a staple in businesses. The IBM PC was one of the fastest selling computers in the world, which challenged the Apple II. 

### The Plant at Research Triangle Park 

 IBM operated a large manufacturing plant at Research Triangle Park. The plant was where IBM operated their production lines. 

### Just-in-Time manufacturing 

Just-in-time (JIT) or continuous-flow manufacturing (CFM) was the method IBM used to be make the plant efficient. It was designed to meet quotas without have a surplus of goods, and have zero inventory. 

### Cook's First Job 

Cook learned about JIT at IBM performing his first job of pipeline management. He had to make sure the factory had enough parts to make its PCs. 

### Cook's High Potential 

Cook caught the attention of leaders at IBM and they noticed his high potential. He was placed number one on the HiPo list, which was on a fast track for management at IBM. 

### Cook's MBA 

Cook obtained an MBA at Duke University, being paid by IBM. Cook would work in the day and took evening classes at Duke. Obtaining an MBA helped Cook tackle management problems at IBM, which an engineering degree was not enough for. 

### Early Ethics 

Despite the ethical issues of the tech-industry, Cook's ethical stance at Apple stands out. In a class reunion talk at Duke in 2013, Cook said "When I think of ethics, I think of leaving things better than you found them. And to me, that goes from everything from environmentally, to how you work with suppliers with labor questions, to the carbon footprint of your products, to the things you choose to support, to the way you treat your employees.... Your whole persona fits under that umbrella." 

### IBM Social Life 

Although Cook seemed to distance himself from other people at IBM, others wouldn't consider him a loner. Cook was close with many of his peers, and was also very socialable. 

### Promotions at IBM 

Tim stayed at IBM for a dozen years and was promoted to second-manager. One Christmas, with a lot of executives taking a break, Cook volunteered to step in and manage a plant under pressure to ship a lot of computers. Tim performed well and was promoted to director of fulfillment for North America. 

### Cook Moves to Intelligent Electronics 

Tim left IBM in 1994 to become the COO of Intelligent Electronics. Cook was given a large bonus, which prompted the move. Shortly, in 1997, IE was sold to General Electric. 

### Cook Joins Compaq 

Cook joined Compaq after IE was sold. At that point, Compaq had overtaken Apple and IBM as the world's biggest PC manufacturer. Cook helped Compaq move to a build-to-order manufacturing model, which was an offspring of JIT and Compaq called the "Optimized Distribution Model". Steve Jobs at Apple needed someone like Cook to optimize their own manufacturing, and soon Cook joined Apple after 6 months at Compaq. 

## Chapter 4: A Once in a Lifetime Opportunity to Join a Near-Bankrupt Company 

Cook joined Apple in 1998, when Apple was near bankrupt and nobody wanted to work there. 

### A Meeting of Minds: Cook Meets Jobs 

Cook turned down Apple recruiters multiple times but he eventually decided to meet with Steve. This meeting persuaded Cook to join Apple. Cook believed joining Apple would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

### New leader of Ops 

Cook was hired in March 1998 as senior vice president of worldwide operations. This proved to be one of Jobs' best hires. Apple had struggled at operations and Tim was perfect for the role. 

### Goodbye, U.S. Manufacturing. Hello, China! 

In 7 months at Apple, Cook reduced inventory from 30 days to just 6. Cook cut down Apple's product line to just four models, which made oepratiosn much simpler. Cook also met with Apple's suppliers and convinced them to move closer to Apple's own factories. Apple also outsourced whenever possible, which would help with inventory. Cook hated inventory just as Jobs hated shoddy design. 

Good inventory management rested on the ability to forecast sales in advance. Cook invested in a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning system which improved forecasting. 

Cook's overhaul of operations would help bring Apple back towards the path of profitability. 

## Chapter 5: Saving Apple Through Outsourcing 

### Foxconn 

Foxconn was a manufacturing company in Asia which provided Apple was flexible and cheap labor. Previously, Jobs had built his own manufacturing plant which was fully automated, but it was inflexible and sales could not cover the cost of operating the plant. Partnering with Foxconn was critical to the success of Apple scaling their business and products. 

### Cook Climbs the Ladder 

In 2005 Cook was promoted to COO and seemed to be groomed to be Jobs' successor. Everyone at Apple was a specialist, with the exception of Jobs and Cook. Cook was considered Jobs' right hand man and oversaw the entire operations at Apple. 

### Cook the Manager 

Cook was very different from Jobs as a leader. He was very quiet and wasn't a screamer. He would ask questions to keep his employees accountable. Cook would also pay heavy attention to detail, and noticed even the slightest changes. 

Cook also empowered his staff to make decisions for themselves and encouraged creativity. 

Cook himself had very little life outside of Apple. He would work until 3:45 am but was at his desk 6 am each morning. Cook also was very health-conscious, and exercised a lot. 

Cook managed to keep a very private persona despite being interim CEO twice when Jobs had to take a leave of absence. This changed however when Tim became permanent CEO. 

## Chapter 6: Stepping into Steve Jobs's Shoes 

Becoming CEO meant that Tim had to step into the public. 

### Wooden as Pinocchio 

In 2012, Cook's first setbacks were trying to maintain a good public presentation. Cook didn't have the charisma that Jobs did. This caused the iPad 3 to be released with mixed reviews. 

### Early Setbacks 

Other setbacks Cook faced was being sued by the US DOJ for e-book price fixing. This ended up with Apple having to pay a fine. Apple also fell short of the expected iPhone sales, which may have been due to growing competition from Android. 

### Hiring and Firing 

John Browett was hired by Cook to be senior vice president of retail. However, Browett did not fit Apple's culture of being service oriented. Browett tried to cut costs on customer service, so Cook fired him. 

Scott Forstall, executive of softwares MacOS and iOS, also left the company after Jobs' death. This was after 2 of Apple's software products, Apple Maps and Siri, failed. Although it wasn't publically stated why Forstall left Apple, it was implied that Cook fired him. 

Forstall had a difficult personality and often clashed with other executives at Apple. Jobs liked and trusted Forstall which secured his position, but once Jobs died, Forstall no longer had this security. Some speculate that Forstall was fired due to defying a direct order from Tim Cook to apologize for the failure of Apple Maps. 

### Passed Peak Apple? 

In the wake of these firings, many thought Apple had passed its peak. Although Apple was still doing well financially, many thought it was because of the legacy of Jobs. 

### Cook Starts to Change Apple 

Five months after becoming CEO, Cook held a town hall to discuss Apple's philanthropic efforts. This was a huge success and Apple had a program of matching up to $10,000 each employee donated annually. However, critics say that the money Apple donates falls short to the labor issues Apple tolerates in its supply chain. 

### Supply Chain Initiatives 

The New York Times published an investigation on Foxconn, which was Apple's manufacturer, for their exploitative practices. In response, Cook hired the Fair Labor Association to audit Foxconn factories. Cook would also addressed worker abuse charges in a keynote speech, saying that he cared about worker conditions and promised reform. Previously under Jobs, several workers had committed suicide after working for Foxconn, and Jobs showed an indifference. Under Cook, Apple did make some reforms, but many claimed the issue problem was that Apple was outsourcing their labor. They claimed it was a systemic issue which arose from Apple looking for the cheapest bidder.

Nevertheless, under Cook, Apple did improve the conditions workers faced in its supply chain. 

### Success on the Horizon 

Apple released the iPhone 5 in September 2012, the first iPhone released after Jobs' death. This was a massive success. In December 2012, Cook was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people. 

Al Gore said of Cook: 

    "It is difficult to imagine a harder challenge than following the legendary Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple. Yet Tim Cook, a soft-spoken, genuinely humble and quietly intense son of an Alabama shipyard worker and a homemaker, hasn't missed a single beat. Fiercely protective of Jobs' legacy and deeply immersed in Apple's culture, Cook, 51, has already led the world's most valuable and innovative company to new heights while implementing major policy changes smoothly and brilliantly. He was indelibly imprinted his leadership on all areas of Apple--from managing its complex inner workings to identifying and shepherding new "insanely great" technology and design breakthroughs into the product pipeline." 

## Chapter 7: Finding his Feet with Hot New Products 

In 2013, despite Apple's record profit, it's share price fell. Shareholders were wary of growing competition from Android, and it was also difficult to grow a company as large as Apple. Apple soon began tapping into the Chinese market to expand. 

### Tax Dodging 

Apple was accused of dodging taxes by keeping much of their cash in offshore accounts. Cook testified before congress and it was found that Apple was following the Tax code, but was using it to benefit Apple through loopholes. 

### Mac Pro + iOS 7 

Mac Pro and iOS 7, led by chief designer Jony Ive, were released to mixed reviews. Nevertheless, many of the core designs of Mac Pro and iOS 7 are still around today. 

### iPhone 5s Sets Records 

iPhone 5s added fingerprint scan and A7 chip architecture, which was innovative and was reflected in its sales. 

### A Good End to the Year 

Though 2013 began with a fall in share price, Apple achieved a record revenue of $57.6 billion and a net profit of $13.1 billion. 

### WWDC--iOS 8 and a Health Push 

In 2014, Apple announced the release of HealthKit and the programming language Swift. 

### Angela Ahrendts 

In October 2013, Cook hired Angela Ahrendts to replace John Browett. She was the first woman on Apple's executive team, and proved to be a great fit. 

### Tim Cook's Tim Cook 

In December 2015, Cook promoted Jeff Williams to the role of COO. He is very similar to Cook, and oversaw many of the issues Apple faced with supply chains, operations, and social responsibility initiatives. 

### Surprising Partnerships 

In 2014, Apple acquired Beats. 

### Partnership with IBM -- iOS in Enterprise 

In 2014, Apple partnered with IBM to create enterprise Apps for iOS. This proved to be a success for both parties.  

### iPhone 6 and Apple Pay 

iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus were the most successful Apple products to date, which came equipped with Apple pay. However, a controversy arose from the iPhone 6 plus, which was called "bendgate". Users alleged that the iPhone 6 plus would bend.

### Embarrassing iOS 8.0.1 Bug 

Users also experienced a bug which prevented them from making calls, but a patch was released in 2 days. 

### Apple Pay 

Cook believed Apple Pay would be a success by focusing on the privacy aspect. While it did take off a bit slower than expected, it still was a small success. 

### Cook's First Major Product: Apple Watch 

In September 2014, Cook unveiled the Apple Watch. In April 2015, it was  released to the public. WatchOS was the  custom OS for Apple Watch, and custom apps were built for it. The Apple Watch completely disrupted the smartwatch industry. At this point, Apple was the most valuable company in the world, valued at over $700 billion and any doubts about Cook's leadership were erased. 

## Chapter 8: A Greener Apple

Apple is one of the greenest companies due to the environmental efforts by Tim Cook. Under Jobs, sustainability was an afterthought. 

### Pollution and Poison 

Apple had a scandal in its factories for using n-hexane, a chemical which would cause nerve damage, because it increased efficiency. Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, published reports of Apple's damage to the environment. 

### Change for the Better 

After Cook took over, Apple organized a meeting with with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Ma. After the meeting, Ma believed that Apple was changing for the better. 

### Dirty Data 

The Apple Tim inherited from Jobs was labeled the "least green" tech company. It's iCloud data center was one of the dirtiest in the country. This led to protests by Greenpeace at Apple stores. 

### Cook Sets to Work 

Cook responds to these protests by promising to switch to renewable energy by 2012. Greenpeace would later release a statement praising Apple's efforts. However, Apple had other issues, namely in China, where they were polluting a river. 

### Enter the EPA 

Cook decided to hire Lisa Jackson, former head of the EPA to Apple's executive team. This was part of Cook's larger plan to make Apple a greener company and showed that Cook was serious about his efforts. 

### A Force for Good 

Apple quickly started climbing Greenpeace rankings, and in 2014 it was named as having one of the cleanest data centers. 

### Cook ramps up Solar 

Apple begins to invest in solar energy, building a $850 million solar energy farm in California. Cook stated he was proud of Apple "stepping up our social responsibility". In 2015-2016, Apple made sustainability deals in China, investing in green energy in China. 

### 100 Percent Renewable 

On Earth Day 2018, Apple announced that its facilities was running on 100 percent renewable power. However, most of Apple's carbon footprint is in its supply chain, which Apple is adamant about reducing as well. Apple has set the example and hopefully other companies follow their lead. 

### Closed-Loop Supply Chain 

Cook has an intention of creating Apple products entirely from recycled materials. In 2016, Apple introduced Liam, a robot that can take apart the iPhone 6 so that all of its parts can be recycled. Apple has also done research in finding ways of reducing Carbon emissions in its manufacturing. For example, Apple announced a breakthrough in finding a carbon-free way to smelt aluminum. 

### Sustainable Forests 

Apple committed to source 100% of its packaging from sustainable resources. In the US, Apple is managing 36,000 acres of sustainable forests. However, they are facing issues with replacing styrofoam. 

### A Dedicated CEO 

Cook is very involved in Apple's sustainability efforts, and is ahead of the curve in that regard. Cook is setting a public example for not only other companies, but Apple's customers as well. 

## Chapter 9: Cook Fights the Law, and Wins 

Under Cook, Apple's iOS and MacOS updates would increasingly become more privacy focused. Cook promised to not monetize the data that it collected from its users for ad purposes. Apple would also make encryption tied down to the user's passcode, and would not provide a backdoor for government agencies to hack into iOS devices. 

### Privacy Concerns 

In December 2013, the public became outraged at one of the NSA's softwares being able to eavesdrop on communications from iPhones. Apple claimed it had nothing to do with the software. Other researchers claimed that Apple could read your iMessage conversations, but Apple denied that too. 

In September 2014, Apple was accused of not taking iCloud security seriously after leaked images of celebrities were released in "Celebgate". However, Apple claimed that it was a targeted attack on usernames and passwords, and not a breach of the iCloud system. Even though this was done through a phishing scheme, Cook promised that Apple would do more to protect their users. 

### San Bernardino 

In 2016, Cook fought the law and won. In 2015, a judge ordered Apple to build a backdoor access for the iPhone used by Syed Farook, the suspect in the San Bernardino shooting. Apple refused, believing that it would be very dangerous. Cook took a stand here because he believed it would be a slippery slope for Apple to hack its own users. 

### Long-Running Debate 

iOS 8 had the strongest encryption on user data ever seen in Smartphones. Not even Apple could break it. Law Enforcement could not access iPhones, and were pressuring Apple for a solution. 

### The Firestorm 

As predicted by Cook, this stance on privacy caused a lot of political, media, and public backlash. A Pew Survey found that 51 percent of the public sided with the FBI, while only 38 percent sided with Cook. Other Surveys indicated a 46 percent support for Apple and a 35 percent disagreement. It was clear the public was divided. 

### The War Room 

Cook gave a prime-time interview with ABC News which explained his stance on the issue. It went well and was the most important interview Cook gave as CEO. In a later case, a judge sided with Apple against the FBI. This gave Apple much needed support. 

### No Privacy in America 

Despite this, the public was still very divided. The United Nations would voice its support for Apple. However, Attorney General Loretta Lynch would criticize Apple for essentially defying the law and the courts. 

### The Case is Dropped 

The FBI decided to drop the case after gaining access to Farook's iPhone, because it turns out they could access the iPhone without Apple's help. 

### Cook Doubles Down on Privacy 

Apple continued to improve on its privacy protections with iOS 11.3, which made it clear to users when their personal data was being collected. This coincided with Facebook's controversial privacy practices, which provided a contrast being Apple and Facebook's policies. 

## Chapter 10: Doubling Down on Diversity 

On October 30, 2014, Cook confirmed to the public that he was gay. Cook did so because he believed it was a sacrifice to help a generation of young people be comfortable in their own skin. 

### Person of the Year 

Cook was named Person of the Year by the Financial Times in 2014. This was due to both his success leading Apple economically, but also ethically. 

### Equality and Diversity Are Good for Business 

Cook's sexuality influenced his outlook on equality and diversity. He published an article "Workplace Equality Is Good for Business" in Wall Street Journal. There, he argued that congress should pass the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. The bill was passed in 2013. 

### Innovation Through Diversity 

Although Cook appreciated his executive team because they were diverse in thought, they lacked true diversity in race and gender. Cook encouraged the employment of minorities, like the disabled and veterans. 

### Promoting Women 

Cook also tried to promote women in the tech industry. He believed having a woman role model would inspire younger girls to pursue a career in tech. 

### Apple's Makeup 

In August 2014, Apple's first diversity report was largely White and Male. Cook expressed disappointment with these results. Unfortunately, Apple has not made much progress in this regard. 

### Shareholder Pressure 

Shareholders have pressured Apple to adopt an "accelerated recruitment policy" to increase diversity. Apple however, declined, saying it wasn't necessary to it's vision of increasing diversity, as they knew it would take time. 

### Cook's Education Initiatives 

Apple has used education initiatives to try to increase diversity. Apple built and funded programs to help minorities pursue an education. For example, Apple teamed up with and donated $10 million to the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) to help develop women in STEM.  

### Sowing Early Seeds 

Apple is also reaching earlier to high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools to develop STEM in K-12 schools. 

### Accessibility 

Cook has also made accessibility an important focus for Apple products. He wants to make sure all Apple products are designed so that everyone can use them. Softwares like VoiceOver technology and Braille help disabled users use their technology.  

## Chapter 11: Robot Cars and the Future of Apple 

On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first company to reach a $1 trillion valuation. Many attributed this valuation to the success of Apple products like the iPhone. 

### Future Initiatives 

Apple has been developing Project Titan, which is a secretive self-driving-car project. This project was assigned to Apple's VP of product design, Steve Zadesky, but he left in 2016. Later, the project was assigned to Bob Mansfield, where the project became "rebooted" and several employees were laid off. 

As of now, it's unclear what the status of Project Titan is, but many speculate that it is the biggest failure of the Tim Cook era. 

Cook's failure was due to him hiring too many outsiders, growing the project too quickly, then having to lay them off in a couple of years. 

### Apple Park 

Apple Park opened in April 2017, which was one of Jobs' last projects at Apple. It was a gigantic spaceship shaped headquarters for Apple. 

### Campus Opening 

Apple Park opened in April 2017, and perfectly summed up the relationship between the legacy of Steve Jobs, as well as the present of Tim Cook. 

### Not Everything Was a Success 

Some criticized Apple Park for being closed to the public. Some employees had issues with seeing the glass and cut their heads walking into it. Yet others criticized the building for being sterile and isolated, and devoid of humanity. 

### Fostering Collaboration 

Apple Park's circular design allowed for greater collaboration. It features a large open space, and it was actually Steve Jobs' idea. 

### It Seems to Be Working 

During the Author's visit to Apple Park, it seemed to be busy with interaction. 

### Enter the X, the Next-Gen iPHone 

On September 2017, Cook would announce the Next-Gen iPhone X, because it marked a decade of the iPhone. Cook claimed it was the biggest innovation to the iPhone and charged a premium for it. It was a massive success. 

## Chapter 12: Apple's Best CEO?

Jobs was a great visionary, but he was never really a CEO. He was the head of product, and was arguably a bad CEO. Cook is much better suited running Apple in ways Jobs could not. 

### Can Cook Innovate? 

Many have questioned whether Apple can innovate under Cook as it did under Jobs. But it's important to note that for Jobs, many of the products weren't instant successes, and took time for them to catch on. 

### Innovations Take Time

The Apple Watch is following a similar pattern to Jobs' products.Apple also innovated in other areas under Cook. For example, Airpods, Apple Pay, Face ID, and the iPhone X are all well received. 

### Lessons Learned 

Cook was an unlikely candidate to succeed Steve Jobs, given his background and upbringing. Many expected Steve to be the one to bring Apple to the heights it has achieved. But Cook managed to bring Apple to new heights due to being different from Jobs. Cook's care for ethics, his focus on diversity and equality, his care for workers and the environment, and his conviction for his strong personal beliefs allowed Apple to grow into the company it is today.
